To setup the necessary environment, you must first run the setup script
(./bin/setup from where this file is).

This script will compile a number of packages for use by the makeptf family of
scripts and create a script called set_path: source this file to add the path to
the utilities to your PATH variable.

See README file for more info on how to use this software.
