This software has been written by Herve Fache, between March 2005 and September
2006.


PREREQUISITES

Before you can use the scripts to create packages, disc images and ramdisks,
you must have set your environment up. Please read the INSTALL file for
information on how to do that.

CONVENTIONS

I will use the hash sign (#) when showing an example of command to be typed at
the prompt of a shell.

SETTING THE ENVIRONMENT

To tell the system where to find executables for this software, source the
set_path file:
# source set_path

To let the system know where to repository is, source the set_repository file:
# source set_repository

You are now ready to work.

WHERE TO FIND HELP

The makeptf* scripts have embedded help, and will show usage information when
invoked with the -h or --help option.

Basically, they try to do most of the work for you.

MAKEPTF

makeptf is the lowest level script and takes a package name as argument.
makeptf needs to be told where the root of your file system (prefix) is, using
the -p option. For example:
# makeptf -p /home/user/infra/projects/myproject/image busybox

You could also set the prefix in you environment, like so:
# export PREFIX=/home/user/infra/projects/myproject/image

makeptf can also be told which version of the software to use:
# makeptf busybox 1.00

makeptf is really interested in the configuration file (config) and the package
configuration file for some packages (busybox, linux kernel).
The default for the configuration directory is $PREFIX/etc/makeptf/.

Once a package has been added, it is usually compiled as part of an image, using
makeptf-list.

MAKEPTF-LIST

makeptf-list is used to create a list of packages. The list is in a file called
list which resides in the configuration directory.

For simplicity, makeptf-list will assume that the prefix is the current
directory unless told otherwise.

To create a bzip-compressed tar of the resulting build:
# makeptf-list -P ../package.tar.bz2

To create a gzip-compressed disc image (e.g. a RAM disk):
# makeptf-list -I ../image.gz

Unfortunately, the kernel creation could not be tested, due to lack of time and
interest at higher levels.
